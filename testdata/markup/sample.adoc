This is a sample AsciiDoc document for testing the AsciiDoc chunker.

== Introduction

AsciiDoc is a lightweight markup language for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, and more.

=== Key Features

The format supports many features:

* Rich text formatting
* Tables and lists
* Code blocks with syntax highlighting
* Cross-references and links

=== Document Structure

AsciiDoc documents are organized into sections using heading markers:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Document Title (Level 0)
== Section (Level 1)
=== Subsection (Level 2)
==== Sub-subsection (Level 3)
----

== Installation

To get started with AsciiDoc, you need to install a processor.

=== Using Ruby

Install Asciidoctor gem:

[source,bash]
----
gem install asciidoctor
----

=== Using Docker

Alternatively, use Docker:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/documents/ asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor asciidoctor sample.adoc
----

=== Using npm

== Text Formatting

AsciiDoc supports various text styles:

*Bold text* is marked with asterisks.

_Italic text_ is marked with underscores.

`Monospace text` is marked with backticks.

*_Bold italic_* combines both styles.

== Lists

=== Unordered Lists

* First item
* Second item
** Nested item
** Another nested item

=== Ordered Lists

. First step
. Second step
.. Substep A
.. Substep B
. Third step

=== Definition Lists

Term 2::
  Definition of term 2

== Tables

.Sample Table
[cols="1,2,1",options="header"]
|===
|Column 1 |Column 2 |Column 3

|Cell A1
|Cell A2
|Cell A3

|Cell B1
|Cell B2
|Cell B3
|===

== Code Blocks

=== Inline Code

Use `git status` to check the current state.

=== Source Blocks

[source,python]
----
def calculate_sum(numbers):
    """Calculate the sum of a list of numbers."""
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total

result = calculate_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(f"Sum: {result}")
----

=== With Callouts

[source,java]
----
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) { // <1>
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); // <2>
    }
}
----
<1> Entry point of the application
<2> Print greeting to console
